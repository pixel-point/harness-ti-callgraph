# harness-ti-callgraph

Callgraph visualization demo app

Following functionality available: 

1. Callgraph itself
2. Hovers (data inside is not selectable)
3. Interactions (moving nodes around)
4. Search

App shallowly resembles TI reports page,
but to avoid exposing private codebase I had 
to avoid using exact components and building
new would have taken too much time.
